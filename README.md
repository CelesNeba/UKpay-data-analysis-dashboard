#### Project Objective: Create a simplified version of a digital wallet system tailored to the UK market. The project will simulate essential features like peer-to-peer transfers, utility bill payments, merchant payments, and transaction tracking. I will work on SQL for database design and querying, Python for analytics and backend logic.
